**Integration Test Design (Review Before Implementation):**

```
Test 1: Full Skill Pipeline
  - Input: All 83 skills in src/skills/
  - Steps: compile-plugins -> validate all -> generate-marketplace
  - Assert: All plugins valid, marketplace has 83 entries, no errors

Test 2: Full Stack Pipeline
  - Input: All stacks (fullstack-react, mobx-tailwind, work-stack)
  - Steps: For each stack: compile-stack -> validate -> check agent frontmatter
  - Assert: All stacks compile, agents have skills array, README generated

Test 3: Marketplace Integrity
  - Input: Generated marketplace.json
  - Steps: Parse JSON, verify structure, check all pluginRoot paths resolve
  - Assert: All paths exist, schema valid, no duplicate names

Test 4: Roundtrip (Manual)
  - Steps: Install compiled plugin in ~/.claude/plugins/, run Claude Code
  - Assert: Agents appear in /agents, skills load when agent invoked
```

**Notes:**

- Tests 1-3 can be automated
- Test 4 requires manual verification (Claude Code runtime)
- Tests should be maintainable: use file counts, not hardcoded names
- Tests should fail fast with clear error messages

### 1. CLI Implementation

#### Phase A: Before Repo Split (Do Now)

> Complete these while skills and CLI live in same repo. Focus on making CLI work end-to-end.

| Order | Task                    | Description                                                                           | Status   |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| A4    | Phase 4: Versioning     | Integer version + content hash on compile                                             | **DONE** |
| A7    | Inline agent invocation | Test `--agents` JSON flag with model/tools (see cli/CLI-AGENT-INVOCATION-RESEARCH.md) | Partial  |

**A5/A6 (`cc create skill/agent`) - Won't Do:** Instead of CLI commands that fetch summoner agents via network, users install summoners as optional agents via `cc add skill-summoner` / `cc add agent-summoner` and run them locally like any other agent. See Decision Log entry 2026-01-25.

#### Phase A.5: Simplified Plugin Architecture (CRITICAL)

> **MAJOR REFACTOR:** Eliminate `.claude-collective/` directory entirely. One plugin per project.
> See [SIMPLIFIED-PLUGIN-ARCHITECTURE.md](/.claude/research/findings/v2/SIMPLIFIED-PLUGIN-ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details.

| Order | Task                      | Description                                                      | Status      |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A5.1  | Research migration        | Identify all files referencing stacks/`.claude-collective/`      | Not Started |
| A5.2  | Remove `cc switch`        | Eliminate stack switching entirely                               | Not Started |
| A5.3  | Simplify `cc init`        | Create plugin directly, use "templates" instead of "stacks"      | Not Started |
| A5.4  | Update `cc edit`/`cc add` | Modify plugin directly, not stack                                | Not Started |
| A5.5  | Remove stack files        | Delete stack-list.ts, stack-config.ts, stack-creator.ts          | Not Started |
| A5.6  | Update `cc list`          | Show plugin info (version, skills, agents) instead of stack list | Not Started |
| A5.7  | User migration            | Detect `.claude-collective/` and offer migration prompt          | Not Started |

**Key changes:**

- One project = one plugin (no stacks)
- Everything in `.claude/plugins/claude-collective/`
- Grow plugin with `cc add <skill>` / `cc add <agent>` instead of switching stacks
- "Stacks" become "templates" (starter configurations from marketplace)

#### Phase B: Repo Split (Milestone)

> Split into two repos: `claude-collective-cli` and `claude-collective-skills`

| Order | Task                     | Description                                                          | Status                      |
| ----- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| B1    | CLI Repository Migration | Move CLI to `claude-collective-cli` repo (created 2026-01-22)        | Blocked (awaiting refactor) |
| B2    | Rename Repository        | Rename `claude-subagents` -> `claude-collective-skills`              | Not Started                 |
| B3    | Remote fetching refactor | Refactor compile scripts to use giget/source-fetcher for all content | Not Started                 |

**Note on B3:** Currently compile scripts use direct filesystem paths. After split, they must fetch agents/principles/templates from remote marketplace via giget. This is a medium refactor - needs `ContentProvider` abstraction. Wait until split to avoid premature abstraction.

#### Phase C: After Repo Split

> These require the CLI to fetch from remote marketplace.

| Order | Task                       | Description                                                                                                                                   | Status                |

| C2    | Phase 7: Private Repos     | Configurable source, auth, pre-flight checks                                                                                                  | Partial (config done) |
| C3    | Phase 8: Multi-Source      | Community + private skills composition                                                                                                        | Not Started           |

| C8    | Agent plugins              | Agents become individually installable plugins in marketplace                                                                                 | Not Started           |
| C9    | `cc add <agent>`           | Install individual agents (e.g., `cc add pattern-scout`)                                                                                      | Not Started           |
| C10   | Essential vs optional      | Stacks install ~9-10 essential agents; optional agents installed separately                                                                   | Not Started           |
| C12   | Pre-flight checks          | Token validation before download (verify auth tokens present/valid before starting downloads from private repos)                              | Not Started           |

**Agent Plugins Architecture (C8-C10):**

- **Essential agents** (~8-9): frontend-developer, backend-developer, frontend-reviewer, backend-reviewer, frontend-researcher, backend-researcher, pm, tester
- **Optional agents** (~6): architecture, pattern-scout, pattern-critique, agent-summoner, skill-summoner, documentor
- Stacks install essential agents by default; users add optional agents via `cc add <agent-name>`

| Priority   | Task                               | Description                                                                                                        | Status                                                              |

| LOW        | Remove shared category             | Remove `shared` category from skills-matrix.yaml once reviewing is moved. Added as workaround.                     | **DONE**                                                            |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Skill ID: use frontmatter name~~ | ~~Currently using directory path as skill ID (workaround). Refactor to use `frontmatter.name` as canonical ID, .~~ | **DONE** (2026-01-25)                                               |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~`backend/ci-cd/github-actions`~~ | ~~Remove React Query, Zustand references (frontend libs in backend skill)~~                                        | **DONE** (verified clean)                                           |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~`backend/analytics/posthog`~~    | ~~Review Better Auth, Email references (non-`+` skill with cross-tech refs)~~                                      | **DONE** (integration points, not taught content - properly scoped) |
| Low        | New skills (Critical)              | nx, docker, kubernetes, vite, svelte, supabase, AI SDKs                                                            | Backlog                                                             |
| Low        | New skills (High)                  | astro, firebase, clerk, cloudflare, terraform, etc.                                                                | Backlog                                                             |
| Low        | Roadmap Phase 3-5                  | background-jobs, caching, i18n, payments, etc.                                                                     | Backlog                                                             |

**Note on `+` skills:** Skills with `+` in the name (e.g., `backend/observability+axiom+pino+sentry`) are intentionally integrated "bridge" skills. Cross-tech references between the named technologies are expected and correct. Only **frontend** library references (React, React Query, Zustand) in backend skills are problematic.

**Note on skill ID resolution (RESOLVED 2026-01-25):** Skill IDs now consistently use the canonical frontmatter name (e.g., `frontend/react (@vince)`) everywhere:

- Agent frontmatter `skills:` array
- Dynamic skill invocation commands
- Skill directory paths (e.g., `skills/frontend/react (@vince)/`)
- Skill frontmatter `name` field

This preserves category prefixes (frontend/, backend/) for disambiguation and author attribution (@vince).

### 4. Versioning

> **COMPLETED (2026-01-25)**: Integer versioning with content hash in `plugin.json`.
> See `VERSIONING-IMPROVEMENT-TRACKER.md` for implementation details.

## Decision Log

| Date       | Decision                           | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-01-25 | **Simplified plugin architecture** | One plugin per project, eliminate `.claude-collective/` entirely. Grow plugin with `cc add` instead of switching stacks. "Stacks" become "templates". See `SIMPLIFIED-PLUGIN-ARCHITECTURE.md`.                                                |
| 2026-01-25 | Version deprecated in metadata     | `version` field removed from metadata.yaml and types. Version lives only in `plugin.json`. `content_hash` is primary identifier for change detection.                                                                                         |
| 2026-01-25 | Summoners as local agents          | `cc create skill/agent` commands won't do. Users install skill-summoner/agent-summoner as optional agents (`cc add`), run locally. Avoids network dependency, works offline, consistent with other agents. Staleness caught by `cc validate`. |
| 2026-01-25 | Thinking budget: use defaults      | Claude Code defaults to max thinking (31,999 tokens) since Jan 2026. Ultrathink keywords deprecated. No need to configure per-agent - defer CLI configurability to later.                                                                     |
| 2026-01-25 | Core principles in template        | Embedded directly in agent.liquid (not a skill). Methodology content available via skills. External skill sources deferred - would need `cc add --source` to fetch to local.                                                                  |
| 2026-01-24 | Agents as individual plugins       | **Future**: Agents will be standalone installable plugins. Stacks install ~9-10 essential agents; users can add others via `cc add agent-name`.                                                                                               |
| 2026-01-24 | Plugin-based versioning            | Skills, agents, and stacks are ALL plugins. Version goes in `plugin.json`, NOT `metadata.yaml`. Single versioning model for all artifacts.                                                                                                    |
| 2026-01-24 | Stack-based architecture           | Skills stored in `.claude-collective/stacks/` (project-local), single plugin at `.claude/plugins/claude-collective/` (project-local). `cc switch` for instant switching.                                                                      |
| 2026-01-24 | Dual marketplace model             | Public marketplace (community, latest) + private/company marketplaces (pinned versions). Enables reproducibility and guardrails.                                                                                                              |
| 2026-01-24 | Agents as standalone plugins       | Agents don't embed skills; they reference them. One documentor for all stacks. `cc switch` recompiles with active stack's skills.                                                                                                             |
| 2026-01-24 | Version pinning via marketplace    | No `plugin@version` install syntax. Marketplace controls versions via `ref`/`sha` in marketplace.json. Maintainer is gatekeeper.                                                                                                              |
| 2026-01-24 | Skills/Agents/Stacks independent   | Each versioned independently. No cascading bumps. Binding happens at switch/compile time, not publish time.                                                                                                                                   |
| 2026-01-23 | Remote fetching after repo split   | Compile scripts use local paths now; refactor to giget/source-fetcher AFTER repos split. Avoids premature abstraction.                                                                                                                        |

## Quick Reference

### Run CLI

```bash
bun src/cli/index.ts init
bun src/cli/index.ts edit
bun src/cli/index.ts switch
bun src/cli/index.ts list
```

### Compile Plugins

```bash
# Compile all skills to plugins
bun src/cli/index.ts compile-plugins

# Compile specific stack to plugin
bun src/cli/index.ts compile-stack -s fullstack-react

# Generate marketplace
bun src/cli/index.ts generate-marketplace

# Validate plugins
bun src/cli/index.ts validate dist/plugins --all

# Bump version
bun src/cli/index.ts version patch
```

### Compile Agents

```bash
cc switch home-stack && cc compile
cc switch work-stack && cc compile
```

### Test Matrix Loading

```bash
bun src/cli/index.ts init  # Loads 76 skills, 11 stacks
```

### Test Inline Agent Invocation (2026-01-22 Discovery)

See `CLI-AGENT-INVOCATION-RESEARCH.md` for full details.

```bash
# VERIFIED WORKING - Basic test via CLI
bun src/cli/index.ts test-agent

# VERIFIED WORKING - Direct invocation
claude --agents '{"test": {"description": "Test agent", "prompt": "You are a test agent. Say hello."}}' --agent test -p "Hello"

# TODO: Test with model and tools restrictions
claude --agents '{"test": {"description": "Test", "prompt": "List files in current directory", "model": "haiku", "tools": ["Bash"]}}' --agent test -p "List files"

# TODO: Test with full skill-summoner content (~2000 lines)
```

**Verified (2026-01-22):**

- CLI subprocess inherits Claude auth
- `--agents` JSON flag works for inline agent definitions
- `--agent` flag can reference inline-defined agents
- `-p` flag works for non-interactive mode

**Remaining questions:**

1. Does `--agents` JSON accept `model` and `tools` fields?
2. Are tool restrictions enforced?
3. Does it work with large prompts (~2000 lines)?

## CLI Implementation (Phase 1-3) - Complete

- [x] `cc init` - Creates .claude/, copies skills
- [x] `cc compile` - Compiles agents with skills
- [x] `cc edit` - Edit skills in active stack (replaced `cc add`)
- [x] `cc update` - Update existing stack's skill selection
- [x] `cc switch` - Switch between stacks (with optional interactive selector)
- [x] `cc list` - List all stacks with active marker and skill counts
- [x] `src/cli/lib/hash.ts` - content hashing utility
- [x] `src/cli/lib/skill-copier.ts` - copy skills to local stack
- [x] `src/cli/lib/stack-config.ts` - stack config handling
- [x] `src/cli/lib/stack-creator.ts` - shared stack creation logic
- [x] `src/cli/lib/stack-list.ts` - shared stack listing utility
- [x] `src/cli/lib/stack-skills.ts` - map installed skills to IDs

## Phase A Completed

| Task                          | Description                                                   | Completed  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| A1: Stack plugin on init      | `cc init` creates complete plugin with skills + agents        | 2026-01-24 |
| A2: Implement recompileAgents | `cc edit` automatically recompiles agents after skill changes | 2026-01-24 |
| A3: Manual testing            | All 18 tests pass (MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md)                   | 2026-01-24 |

## Configuration System (2026-01-22)

Full configuration system for CLI-skills communication:

- `cc config show` - Show effective configuration with precedence chain
- `cc config set <key> <value>` - Set project config (`.claude-collective/config.yaml`)
- `cc config set-project <key> <value>` - Set project config (`.claude-collective/config.yaml`)
- `cc config get <key>` - Get resolved config value
- `cc config unset <key>` - Remove global config value
- `cc config unset-project <key>` - Remove project config value
- `cc config path` - Show config file paths
- `--source` flag on `init`, `add`, `update` commands
- `CC_SOURCE` environment variable support
- Precedence: flag > env > project > global > default
- Default source: `github:claude-collective/skills`

## Agent Category Reorganization (2026-01-22)

Completed the reorganization of agents into semantic categories:

**Before:**

```
src/agents/
├── frontend-developer/
├── backend-developer/
├── pm/
└── ...
```

**After:**

```
src/agents/
├── _templates/            # LiquidJS templates (includes embedded core principles)
├── developer/
│   ├── frontend-developer/
│   └── backend-developer/
├── reviewer/
│   ├── frontend-reviewer/
│   └── backend-reviewer/
├── researcher/
│   ├── frontend-researcher/
│   └── backend-researcher/
├── planning/
│   ├── pm/
│   └── architecture/
├── pattern/
│   ├── pattern-scout/
│   └── pattern-critique/
├── meta/
│   ├── agent-summoner/
│   ├── skill-summoner/
│   └── documentor/
└── tester/
    └── tester-agent/
```

**Changes made:**

- Moved all 15 agents into 7 category directories
- Moved `templates/` to `agents/_templates/`
- Updated compiler to handle nested category structure
- Updated all documentation references
- Validated compilation still works

**Update (2026-01-25):** Core principles are now embedded directly in `agent.liquid` template. The `_principles/` directory has been removed. Methodology content (investigation requirements, write verification, etc.) is available via methodology skills.

## Versioning & Provenance (2026-01-22)

- [x] `forked_from` provenance tracking - Added to metadata.schema.json
- [x] `skill-copier.ts` - Injects forked_from when copying skills
- [x] All 35 existing stack skills updated with forked_from metadata

## Skills Research

- [x] All 76 skills researched and aliases verified
- [x] Matrix loader connected - uses full skill extraction
- [x] 11 pre-built stacks validate correctly
- [x] 99.5% of automated tests pass

## Architecture Decisions

- [x] Versioning: Content-hash + date hybrid (decided)
- [x] Skills-matrix structure: Keep relationship-centric (decided)
- [x] CLI architecture: While-loop wizard beats action/reducer (decided)

# Reference Documentation

> The sections below contain implementation details, specifications, and architectural context.

---

## Versioning System Specification

> **Architecture Update (2026-01-24)**: Skills, agents, and stacks are ALL plugins.
> Version lives in `plugin.json`, NOT in `metadata.yaml` or SKILL.md frontmatter.
> The existing `versioning.ts` predates this architecture and needs refactoring.

### Target Format (Plugin-Based)

```json
// In plugin.json (all plugins: skills, agents, stacks)
{
  "name": "skill-react",
  "version": "1.0.4",
  "description": "Component architecture, hooks, patterns",
  "content_hash": "a1b2c3d"
}
```

### Key Principles

1. **Skills are plugins** - Each skill compiles to a plugin with its own `plugin.json`
2. **Agents are plugins** - Each compiled agent is a plugin with its own `plugin.json`
3. **Stacks are plugins** - Each stack is a plugin that references skill/agent plugins
4. **Version in one place** - `plugin.json` is the single source of truth for version
5. **Content hash for change detection** - Hash detects actual content changes

### Implementation Status

- Hash utility: **DONE** (`src/cli/lib/hash.ts`)
- Versioning logic: **NEEDS REFACTOR** (`src/cli/lib/versioning.ts` outputs to `metadata.yaml`)
- Target: Versioning should update `plugin.json` during `cc compile-plugins`, `cc compile-stack`

### Migration Path

1. During `compile-plugins`: Generate `plugin.json` with version, bump on content change
2. During `compile-stack`: Generate `plugin.json` for the stack plugin
3. Remove version field from `metadata.yaml` (keep for backward compatibility initially)
4. Update CLI display to read version from `plugin.json`

## Directory Structure (User's Project)

After running `cc init --name home-stack` + `cc init --name work-stack`:

```
my-project/
├── .claude-collective/              # SOURCE (our domain, project-local)
│   ├── config.yaml                  # active_stack, source
│   └── stacks/
│       ├── home-stack/
│       │   └── skills/
│       │       ├── react/SKILL.md
│       │       └── zustand/SKILL.md
│       └── work-stack/
│           └── skills/
│               ├── react/SKILL.md
│               └── hono/SKILL.md
│
├── .claude/
│   └── plugins/
│       └── claude-collective/       # OUTPUT (Claude Code's domain, project-local)
│           ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
│           ├── agents/              # Compiled agents
│           │   ├── frontend-developer.md
│           │   └── backend-developer.md
│           └── skills/              # Active stack's skills (copied on switch)
│               ├── react/SKILL.md
│               └── zustand/SKILL.md
│
├── src/
└── package.json
```

**Key principles:**

- `.claude-collective/` and `.claude/plugins/claude-collective/` are both project-local (siblings)
- Skills are namespaced by stack: `.claude-collective/stacks/{name}/skills/`
- `cc switch` copies skills from stack to plugin
- No global paths (`~/`) - everything is in the project directory

See `.claude/research/findings/v2/CLAUDE-COLLECTIVE-DIRECTORY-IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full implementation plan.

## Phase 7: Private Repository Support (Detailed)

### 7.1 Configuration

```yaml
# .claude-collective/config.yaml (project-local)
source: github.com/mycompany/private-skills

# .claude/cc-config.yaml (project - overrides global)
source: github.com/team/team-skills
```

**Precedence**: CLI flag > Project config > Global config > Env var > Default

### 7.2 CLI Changes

- `--source <url>` flag on `cc init`, `cc edit`, `cc update`
- `cc config set source <url>` - set source URL
- `cc config get source` - show current source
- `cc config show` - show all effective configuration

### 7.3 Authentication

| Method            | Environment Variable    | Notes                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| giget native      | `GIGET_AUTH`            | Primary method          |
| GitHub fallback   | `GITHUB_TOKEN`          | Auto-detected           |
| Corporate proxy   | `FORCE_NODE_FETCH=true` | Node 20+ bug workaround |
| Self-signed certs | `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`   | Path to CA bundle       |

### 7.4 Error Mapping

| HTTP Code | User Message                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 401       | "Authentication required. Set GIGET_AUTH or GITHUB_TOKEN"  |
| 403       | "Access denied. Check token permissions (needs repo read)" |
| 404       | "Repository not found or private. Check URL and auth"      |

---

## Phase 8: Multi-Source Composition (Detailed)

### 8.1 Configuration

```yaml
# .claude-collective/config.yaml (project-local)
sources:
  - url: github.com/claude-collective/skills
    name: Community
  - url: github.com/company/private-skills
    name: Company
    auth_env: GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### 8.2 Matrix Merging Rules

1. Fetch `skills-matrix.yaml` from each source
2. Merge categories (private extends/overrides public)
3. Merge `skill_aliases` with source tagging
4. Merge relationships (`conflicts`, `recommends`, `requires`)
5. Handle naming conflicts (prefix with source name)

### 8.3 Wizard Visual Separation

```
-- Framework ----------------------------------------
|  Community                                     |
|  * React @vince                                |
|  * Vue @vince                                  |
|                                                |
|  -----------------------------------------     |
|                                                |
|  Company (Private)                             |
|  * React + Company Patterns @company           |
-------------------------------------------------
```

### 8.4 Edge Cases to Resolve

- Same skill in both sources - Namespace with source prefix or error?
- Private source unreachable - Graceful degradation or hard fail?
- Schema version mismatch - Version check before merge?

## Phase 9: Skill Repository Reorganization (Detailed)

### 9.1 PhotoRoom Skills to Migrate

**Criteria for private repo:**

- Skills with `@photoroom` author
- Company-specific patterns, conventions, internal tooling
- References to internal APIs or services

### 9.2 Community Skills Criteria

**Must be:**

- No company-specific conventions
- Follows official library documentation
- Useful to broader developer community
- Author tagged as `@vince` or community contributor

**Skills to generalize:**

- MobX - General patterns (remove PhotoRoom conventions)
- Tailwind - General patterns (remove PhotoRoom conventions)

## Stack Plugin Architecture (NEW)

> **Goal:** `cc init` creates a complete stack plugin with skills embedded and agents compiled

### Target Structure

When user runs `cc init` and selects skills/stack:

```
.claude/plugins/claude-collective/    # Project-local
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json               # Stack manifest
├── agents/                       # Compiled agents
│   ├── frontend-developer.md
│   ├── backend-developer.md
│   └── ...
└── skills/                       # Skills from active stack (copied on switch)
    ├── react/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── zustand/
    └── ...
```

### Key Points

1. **Skills live inside the stack** - copied to `skills/` folder, not external references
2. **Skills can evolve together** - become cohesive, reference each other within the stack
3. **Versioning** - follows Claude Code's plugin versioning system
4. **Independent updates** - `cc update skill-react` updates that skill within the stack

### `cc init` Flow

1. User selects skills or pre-built stack
2. Create stack folder at `.claude-collective/stacks/{stack-name}/`
3. Copy selected skills to stack's `skills/` folder
4. Create plugin folder at `.claude/plugins/claude-collective/`
5. Copy skills to plugin's `skills/` folder
6. Compile agents to plugin's `agents/` folder
7. Generate `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest

### Commands

| Command           | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `cc init`         | Creates complete stack plugin (skills + agents)      |
| `cc edit`         | Edit skills in stack (add/remove), recompiles agents |
| `cc switch`       | Switch between stacks                                |
| `cc list`         | List all stacks with skill counts                    |
| `cc update --all` | Updates all skills, recompiles agents                |
| `cc compile`      | Recompile agents manually                            |
| `cc outdated`     | Shows which skills have newer versions available     |

### Skill Changes Require Recompilation

Because skills are embedded in compiled agents, **any skill change triggers recompilation**:

- `cc edit` → updates config, adds/removes skills, **recompiles agents**
- `cc update` → fetches latest, replaces skill, **recompiles agents**

### Benefits

- Complete plugin created in one step
- Skills can be customized per-stack
- Skills evolve together as cohesive unit
- Agents always have latest embedded skill content

## Custom Principles (OUTDATED)

> **Status:** This feature needs redesign. Core principles are now embedded directly in the template.

**Update (2026-01-25):** With the move to embedded core principles in `agent.liquid`, the custom principles feature as originally designed is no longer viable. The `_principles/` directory no longer exists.

**Alternative approaches for customization:**

1. **Agent-specific files:** Use `critical-requirements.md` and `critical-reminders.md` in each agent's source directory
2. **Methodology skills:** Create custom methodology skills that can be preloaded
3. **CLAUDE.md:** Add project-specific instructions to the stack's CLAUDE.md file

## CLI Command Specifications

### `cc init`

```
cc init
    |
    v
------------------------------
|  Select a stack or build    |
|  > Use pre-built stack      |
|    Build custom stack       |
------------------------------
    | (wizard)
    v
Creates:
  .claude/stacks/{name}/config.yaml
  .claude/stacks/{name}/skills/...
```

**Detection:** If `.claude/stacks/` exists - "Already initialized. Use `cc init --name <name>` for new stack or `cc edit`"

### `cc edit`

```
cc edit
    |
    v
------------------------------
|  Current skills shown       |
|  as pre-selected            |
------------------------------
    | (same wizard as init)
    v
Updates skills in active stack
```

### `cc update`

```
cc update
    |
    v
------------------------------
|  Your Stacks                |
|  > home-stack (25 skills)   |
|    work-stack (18 skills)   |
------------------------------
    | (select)
    v
------------------------------
|  Same wizard UI as init     |
|  (Pre-populated with        |
|   current selections)       |
------------------------------
```

### Creating Skills and Agents (Won't Do as CLI Commands)

> **Decision (2026-01-25):** Instead of `cc create skill/agent` commands that fetch summoners via network, users install the summoner agents locally and run them like any other agent.

**To create new skills:**

```bash
# 1. Install skill-summoner as an optional agent
cc add skill-summoner

# 2. Run the agent in Claude Code
claude --agent skill-summoner
# Or just invoke it naturally in conversation
```

**To create new agents:**

```bash
# 1. Install agent-summoner as an optional agent
cc add agent-summoner

# 2. Run the agent in Claude Code
claude --agent agent-summoner
```

**Benefits:**

- Works offline (no network fetch on each create)
- Consistent with how all other agents work
- Staleness detected by `cc validate` if schema changes
- User controls when to update summoners
