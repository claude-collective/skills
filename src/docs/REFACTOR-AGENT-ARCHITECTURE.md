# Agent Architecture Refactor

> **Status:** In Progress
> **Goal:** Single source of truth for agents, stacks only select which agents to use

## Summary

Restructure so that:
1. **Agent definitions** live in ONE file (`agents.yaml`) - single source of truth
2. **Stack configs** just reference which agents they want + assign skills
3. **Agent source files** (intro.md, workflow.md) remain generic in `agent-sources/`

## Current State (Before Refactor)

```
src/
├── agent-sources/           # DONE - renamed from agents/ to avoid Claude Code detection
│   └── {agent-name}/
│       ├── intro.md
│       ├── workflow.md
│       └── ...
├── stacks/
│   ├── work/
│   │   ├── config.yaml      # Contains FULL agent definitions (duplicated)
│   │   └── skills/
│   └── home/
│       ├── config.yaml      # Contains FULL agent definitions (duplicated)
│       └── skills/
```

**Problem:** Agent definitions (title, description, model, tools, core_prompts, output_format) are duplicated in each stack's config.yaml.

## Target State (After Refactor)

```
src/
├── agent-sources/           # Generic agent content (unchanged)
│   └── {agent-name}/
│       ├── intro.md
│       ├── workflow.md
│       └── ...
├── agents.yaml              # NEW: Single source of truth for ALL agent definitions
├── stacks/
│   ├── work/
│   │   ├── config.yaml      # SIMPLIFIED: Just lists agents + skill assignments
│   │   └── skills/
│   └── home/
│       ├── config.yaml      # SIMPLIFIED: Just lists agents + skill assignments
│       └── skills/
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Completed
- [x] Renamed `src/agents/` to `src/agent-sources/` to avoid Claude Code auto-detection
- [x] Updated `compile.ts` to use new path
- [x] Updated `CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md` with new directory structure
- [x] Verified compilation still works
- [x] Create `src/agents.yaml` with all agent definitions extracted from current configs
- [x] Update `src/types.ts` with new type definitions
- [x] Update `src/compile.ts` to:
  - [x] Load agents from `agents.yaml`
  - [x] Load stack config with `use_agents` and `agent_skills`
  - [x] Merge agent definition + stack skill assignments at compile time
- [x] Simplify `src/stacks/work/config.yaml` (remove agent definitions, keep only `use_agents` + `agent_skills`)
- [x] Simplify `src/stacks/home/config.yaml` (same)
- [x] Test compilation for both stacks
- [x] Verify Claude Code only sees active stack's agents

### To Do
- [x] Update `CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md` documentation to reflect new structure

## Refactor Complete

All checklist items have been implemented. The system now has:
1. **Single source of truth** for agent definitions in `agents.yaml`
2. **Simplified stack configs** with `use_agents` and `agent_skills`
3. **Updated types** in `types.ts` with `AgentDefinition`, `AgentsConfig`, and `SkillAssignment`
4. **Updated compiler** that loads agents from `agents.yaml` and merges with stack skills

## Files Modified

| File | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/agents.yaml` | CREATED - all agent definitions | ✅ Done |
| `src/types.ts` | UPDATED - new types (AgentDefinition, AgentsConfig, SkillAssignment) | ✅ Done |
| `src/compile.ts` | UPDATED - loads agents.yaml, merges with stack skills | Done |
| `src/stacks/work/config.yaml` | SIMPLIFIED - uses use_agents + agent_skills | Done |
| `src/stacks/home/config.yaml` | SIMPLIFIED - uses use_agents + agent_skills | Done |
| `src/docs/CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md` | UPDATED - documented new structure | ✅ Done |

## Continuation Prompt

Use this prompt in a clean Claude Code context to continue:

```
Continue the agent architecture refactor documented in src/docs/REFACTOR-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md

The goal is to create a single source of truth for agent definitions:
1. Create src/agents.yaml with all agent definitions extracted from the current stack configs
2. Update types.ts with new type definitions
3. Update compile.ts to load agents from agents.yaml and merge with stack-specific skill assignments
4. Simplify both stack config.yaml files to only contain use_agents and agent_skills

Read the REFACTOR-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md file first to understand the current state and target state, then implement the remaining checklist items. Use ultrathink for this task.
