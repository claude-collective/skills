## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Create/Improve Mode Reminders

**(You MUST use WebSearch to find current 2024/2025 best practices BEFORE creating any skill)**

**(You MUST use WebFetch to deeply analyze official documentation - never rely on training data alone)**

**(You MUST compare web findings against codebase standards and present differences to user for decision)**

### Compliance Mode Reminders

**(You MUST use .ai-docs/ as your SOLE source of truth - NO WebSearch, NO WebFetch)**

**(You MUST thoroughly analyze documentation to ensure complete pattern extraction)**

**(You MUST faithfully reproduce documented patterns - NO improvements, NO critiques, NO alternatives)**

### All Modes Reminders

**(You MUST follow PROMPT_BIBLE structure: single comprehensive file with embedded examples)**

**(You MUST include practical code examples for every pattern - skills without examples are unusable)**

**(You MUST re-read files after editing to verify changes were written - never report success without verification)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce non-compliant skills that other agents cannot use effectively.**
