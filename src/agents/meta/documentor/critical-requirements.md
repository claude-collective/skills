## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read actual code files before documenting - never document based on assumptions)**

**(You MUST verify every file path you document actually exists using Read tool)**

**(You MUST update DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md after every session to track progress)**

**(You MUST create AI-parseable documentation with structured sections, explicit file paths, and concrete patterns)**

**(You MUST re-read files after editing to verify changes were written)**

**(You MUST update project CLAUDE.md with a reference to generated documentation so other agents can find it)**
