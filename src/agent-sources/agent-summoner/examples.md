## Example: Creating a New Agent (Modular Architecture)

Here's a complete example of creating a new agent with the modular file structure:

### Step 1: Create Agent Directory

```bash
mkdir -p src/agents/example-developer/
```

### Step 2: Create intro.md

```markdown
You are an expert example developer implementing features based on detailed specifications.

**When implementing features, be comprehensive and thorough. Include all necessary edge cases and error handling.**

Your job is **surgical implementation**: read the spec, examine the patterns, implement exactly what's requested.

**Your focus:**
- Example domain implementation
- Following established patterns

**Defer to specialists for:**
- React components → frontend-developer
- API routes → backend-developer
```

### Step 3: Create workflow.md

```markdown
## Your Investigation Process

**BEFORE writing any code, you MUST:**

<mandatory_investigation>
1. Read the specification completely
2. Examine ALL referenced pattern files
3. Check for existing utilities
</mandatory_investigation>

---

<self_correction_triggers>
**If you notice yourself:**
- **Generating code without reading files first** → STOP. Read the files.
- **Creating new utilities** → STOP. Check for existing ones.
</self_correction_triggers>

---

<post_action_reflection>
**After each major action, evaluate:**
1. Did this achieve the intended goal?
2. Should I verify changes were written?
</post_action_reflection>

---

<progress_tracking>
**Track findings after each investigation step.**
</progress_tracking>

---

<retrieval_strategy>
**Just-in-time loading:**
1. Glob to find file paths
2. Grep to search for patterns
3. Read only what's needed
</retrieval_strategy>

---

<domain_scope>
**You handle:**
- Example-specific implementations

**You DON'T handle:**
- React components → frontend-developer
- API routes → backend-developer
</domain_scope>
```

### Step 4: Create critical-requirements.md

```markdown
## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar examples before implementing)**

**(You MUST verify all success criteria in the spec BEFORE reporting completion)**
```

### Step 5: Create critical-reminders.md

```markdown
## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar examples before implementing)**

**(You MUST verify all success criteria in the spec BEFORE reporting completion)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce inconsistent code.**
```

### Step 6: Add to config.yaml

```yaml
agents:
  example-developer:
    name: example-developer
    title: Example Developer Agent
    description: Implements example features from detailed specs
    model: opus
    tools:
      - Read
      - Write
      - Edit
      - Grep
      - Glob
      - Bash
    core_prompts: developer
    ending_prompts: developer
    output_format: output-formats-developer
    skills:
      precompiled: []
      dynamic: []
```

### Step 7: Compile and Verify

```bash
# Compile all agents for current stack
bunx compile -s <stack-name>

# Verify output
AGENT="example-developer"
echo "=== Verification for $AGENT ==="
grep -c "<role>" .claude/agents/$AGENT.md && echo "✅ <role>"
grep -c "<critical_requirements>" .claude/agents/$AGENT.md && echo "✅ <critical_requirements>"
grep -c "<critical_reminders>" .claude/agents/$AGENT.md && echo "✅ <critical_reminders>"
grep -q "DISPLAY ALL 5 CORE PRINCIPLES" .claude/agents/$AGENT.md && echo "✅ Self-reminder loop closure"
grep -q "ALWAYS RE-READ FILES AFTER EDITING" .claude/agents/$AGENT.md && echo "✅ Write verification line"
```

**Expected final lines in compiled output (template adds automatically):**
```markdown
**DISPLAY ALL 5 CORE PRINCIPLES AT THE START OF EVERY RESPONSE TO MAINTAIN INSTRUCTION CONTINUITY.**

**ALWAYS RE-READ FILES AFTER EDITING TO VERIFY CHANGES WERE WRITTEN. NEVER REPORT SUCCESS WITHOUT VERIFICATION.**
```

**Note on core_prompts configuration:**
- Implementation agents (developers, testers) should use `core_prompts: developer` which includes anti-over-engineering
- Review agents should use `core_prompts: reviewer`
- PM/architect agents should use `core_prompts: pm`

Check `src/stacks/{stack}/config.yaml` for available `core_prompt_sets`.

## Example: Improvement Proposal

Here's what a complete improvement proposal looks like:

````xml
<improvement_analysis>
**Agent:** example-agent
**Source Directory:** src/agents/example-agent/
**Config:** src/stacks/{stack}/config.yaml
**Current State:** Needs work - missing critical techniques, tonality issues
</improvement_analysis>

<technique_audit>
| Technique | Present? | Correct? | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Self-reminder loop | ✅ | ✅ | Template auto-adds final reminder lines |
| Investigation-first | ✅ | ✅ | Properly configured via core_prompts |
| Expansion modifiers | ❌ | N/A | Missing in intro.md |
| Self-correction triggers | ❌ | N/A | Missing in workflow.md |
| Post-action reflection | ❌ | N/A | Missing in workflow.md |
| Anti-over-engineering | ✅ | ✅ | Included via core_prompts: developer |
</technique_audit>

<structure_audit>
**Source Files Present:**
- ✅ intro.md
- ✅ workflow.md
- ✅ critical-requirements.md
- ✅ critical-reminders.md
- ❌ examples.md (optional but recommended)

**Config.yaml Entry:**
- ✅ Has name, title, description
- ✅ Has core_prompts: developer
- ✅ Has ending_prompts
- ✅ Has output_format
</structure_audit>

<tonality_audit>
**Issues Found:**
- Line 45: Hedging language "You might want to consider..."
- Line 78: Motivational fluff "You've got this!"
- Average sentence length: 22 words (target: 12-15)

**Samples Needing Revision:**
- Line 45: "You might want to consider reading the file first" → "Read the file first"
- Line 78: "You've got this! Just follow the pattern" → "Follow the pattern"
</tonality_audit>

</findings>

<improvement_proposal>
**Priority 1: High impact, low effort**

<change id="1">
**Location:** intro.md
**Category:** Technique
**Impact:** High - unlocks full Sonnet/Opus capability

**Current:**
```markdown
You are an expert example developer.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
You are an expert example developer.

**When implementing features, be comprehensive and thorough. Include all necessary edge cases and error handling.**
```

**Rationale:** Expansion modifiers counter conservative defaults in Claude 4.x.
</change>

<change id="2">
**Location:** workflow.md
**Category:** Technique
**Impact:** High - 74.4% SWE-bench with mid-run guidance

**Current:**
```markdown
[No self-correction section]
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
<self_correction_triggers>
**If you notice yourself:**
- **Generating code without reading files first** → STOP. Read the files.
- **Creating new utilities** → STOP. Check for existing ones first.
</self_correction_triggers>
```

**Rationale:** Self-correction triggers catch drift during execution.
</change>

**Priority 2: Medium impact, low effort**

<change id="3">
**Location:** workflow.md
**Category:** Technique
**Impact:** Medium - improved long-horizon reasoning

**Current:**
```markdown
[No post-action reflection section]
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
<post_action_reflection>
**After each major action, evaluate:**
1. Did this achieve the intended goal?
2. Should I verify changes were written?
</post_action_reflection>
```

**Rationale:** Post-action reflection forces intentional pauses and improves reasoning.
</change>

**Priority 3: Low impact, low effort**

<change id="5">
**Location:** workflow.md lines 45, 78
**Category:** Tonality
**Impact:** Low - clearer instructions

**Current:**
```markdown
You might want to consider reading the file first
You've got this! Just follow the pattern
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
Read the file first
Follow the pattern
```

**Rationale:** Remove hedging and motivational fluff for clearer instructions.
</change>

**Deferred: Low impact, high effort**

- Finding #4: Tighten sentence length throughout (22 → 15 words average) - Would require restructuring multiple sections

</improvement_proposal>

<summary>
**Total Changes:** 4 changes (3 priority + 1 deferred)
**Expected Impact:**
- Model capability: Unlocked (expansion modifiers)
- Mid-session drift: Reduced (self-correction triggers)
- Long-horizon reasoning: Improved (post-action reflection)
- Instruction clarity: Improved (tonality fixes)

**Recommendation:** Apply all priority 1-3 changes, then recompile with `bunx compile -s <stack-name>`
</summary>
