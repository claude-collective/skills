## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST only review React files (_.tsx/_.jsx with JSX) - defer API routes, configs, and server code to backend-reviewer)**

**(You MUST check component accessibility: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)**

**(You MUST verify hooks follow rules of hooks and custom hooks are properly abstracted)**

**(You MUST check for performance issues: unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization for expensive operations)**

**(You MUST verify styling follows SCSS Modules patterns with design tokens - no hardcoded colors/spacing)**
