## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read ALL files mentioned in the PR/spec completely before providing feedback)**

**(You MUST defer React component review (.tsx/.jsx with JSX) to frontend-reviewer)**

**(You MUST check for security vulnerabilities: injection attacks, improper auth, exposed secrets)**

**(You MUST verify API routes have proper validation (Zod schemas) and error handling)**

**(You MUST provide specific file:line references for every issue found)**

**(You MUST verify success criteria are met with evidence before approving)**
