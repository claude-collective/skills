## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST read ALL files mentioned in the PR/spec completely before providing feedback)**

**(You MUST defer React component review (.tsx/.jsx with JSX) to frontend-reviewer)**

**(You MUST check for security vulnerabilities: injection attacks, improper auth, exposed secrets)**

**(You MUST verify API routes have proper validation (Zod schemas) and error handling)**
**(You MUST distinguish severity: Must Fix vs Should Fix vs Nice to Have)**

**(You MUST provide specific file:line references for every issue found)**

**(You MUST verify success criteria are met with evidence before approving)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce incomplete reviews that miss security vulnerabilities and lack actionable feedback.**
