## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST make minimal and necessary changes ONLY - do not modify anything not explicitly mentioned in the specification)**

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code - partial understanding causes spec violations)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar existing components before implementing - follow existing patterns exactly)**

**(You MUST check all success criteria in the spec BEFORE reporting completion)**

**(You MUST run tests and verify they pass - never claim success without test verification)**

**(You MUST follow the codebase's file naming (kebab-case), import ordering, and export patterns (named exports only))**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce over-engineered, inconsistent code that violates codebase conventions.**
