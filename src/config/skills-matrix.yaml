relationships:
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # CONFLICTS (Mutually exclusive - selecting A disables B)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  conflicts:
    # Framework conflicts (only one core framework)
    - skills: [react, vue, angular, solidjs]
      reason: "Core frameworks are mutually exclusive - choose one"

    # Meta-framework conflicts
    - skills: [nextjs-app-router, remix, nuxt]
      reason: "Meta-frameworks are mutually exclusive - choose one"

    # Styling conflicts
    - skills: [scss-modules, tailwind]
      reason: "Different CSS paradigms - SCSS Modules vs Tailwind utility-first"

    # Client state management conflicts (React ecosystem)
    - skills: [zustand, redux-toolkit, mobx]
      reason: "React state libraries - choose one approach"

    # Client state management (Vue ecosystem)
    - skills: [pinia, zustand, redux-toolkit, mobx]
      reason: "Pinia is Vue-only, others are React-only"

    # Client state management (Angular ecosystem)
    - skills: [ngrx-signalstore, zustand, pinia, redux-toolkit, mobx]
      reason: "NgRx SignalStore is Angular-only"

    # Server state / data fetching conflicts
    - skills: [react-query, swr]
      reason: "Both solve server state caching - choose one"

    # GraphQL client conflicts
    - skills: [graphql-apollo, graphql-urql]
      reason: "Both are GraphQL clients - choose one"

    # E2E testing conflicts
    - skills: [playwright-e2e, cypress-e2e]
      reason: "Both are E2E frameworks - choose one"

    # Form libraries by framework
    - skills: [react-hook-form, vee-validate]
      reason: "react-hook-form is React-only, vee-validate is Vue-only"

    # Testing library conflicts
    - skills: [react-testing-library, vue-test-utils]
      reason: "Framework-specific testing libraries"

    # Backend API framework conflicts
    - skills: [hono, express, fastify]
      reason: "API frameworks are mutually exclusive"

    # Database ORM conflicts
    - skills: [drizzle, prisma]
      reason: "Both are ORMs - choose one"

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # DISCOURAGES (Soft warnings - selecting A shows warning for B but doesn't disable)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  discourages:
    # Styling paradigm mixing is unusual
    - skills: [scss-modules, tailwind]
      reason: "Mixing CSS paradigms (SCSS Modules + Tailwind) is unusual - most projects pick one approach"

    # Redux is heavy for small projects with Zustand available
    - skills: [redux-toolkit, zustand]
      reason: "Redux Toolkit adds more boilerplate than Zustand - consider if you need its features"

    # SWR is simpler but less featured than React Query
    - skills: [swr, react-query]
      reason: "SWR is simpler but React Query has more features - consider your needs"

    # Express is legacy compared to modern alternatives
    - skills: [express, hono]
      reason: "Express is mature but Hono offers better performance and edge support"

    - skills: [express, fastify]
      reason: "Express is mature but Fastify offers better performance"

    # Cypress vs Playwright for cross-browser
    - skills: [cypress-e2e, playwright-e2e]
