  The Photoroom webapp stack with Tailwind CSS for styling, MobX for state
  management with RootStore pattern, and React Query bridged to MobX via
  MobxQuery. Uses @photoroom/icons and @photoroom/ui for design system.

framework: react

philosophy: "Design system first, move fast"

principles:
  - Wrap ALL components with observer() when reading MobX state
  - Use arrow functions for ALL store methods (preserves this binding)
  - Wrap state mutations after await in runInAction()
  - Use reaction() in stores for side effects, NOT useEffect
  - React Query for server state, MobX for client state
  - Tailwind CSS with @photoroom/ui preset
  - @photoroom/icons for all icons (not lucide-react)
  - Use type for props, NOT interface (ESLint enforced)
