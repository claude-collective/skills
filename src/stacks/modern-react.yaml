philosophy: "Ship fast, iterate faster"

principles:
  - Prefer composition over inheritance
  - Use hooks for everything, avoid class components
  - SCSS Modules for co-located styles, cva for variants
  - Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
  - Test user behavior, not implementation details
  - Type everything - zero tolerance for any
