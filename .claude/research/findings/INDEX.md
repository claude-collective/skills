## Quick Context (Read This First)

**What is this project?**
A modular agent/skill compilation system for Claude Code that uses:

- TypeScript compiler (`.claude-src/compile.ts`)
- LiquidJS templates (`.claude-src/templates/agent.liquid`)
- YAML configs (`registry.yaml` for agents+skills, profile configs)
- Profile switching (home/work) for different tech stacks

**What happened?**
On 2026-01-08, we spawned 12 research agents with ultrathink to analyze every aspect of the architecture. They identified **49 distinct issues** across maintainability, type safety, prompting, scalability, DRY, templates, compilation, profiles, skills, XML tags, model optimization, and testing.

Additionally, **three rounds of open-source research** were completed:
- **Round 1**: Open Source Strategy (4 agents) - CLI onboarding, positioning, profiles, community patterns
- **Round 2**: Community Registry (5 agents) - Skill isolation, dependencies, registry models, bundling
- **Round 3**: Stack Marketplace (5 agents) - Prior art, filtering, unification, viral adoption, schema

**Current Status:**

- Phase 1 (Architecture Research): ✅ Complete (49 issues identified)
- Phase 2 (Synthesis): ✅ Complete
- Phase 3 (Implementation): ⏳ Pending
- Phase 4 (Competitor Analysis): ⏳ Pending
- **Open Source Research: ✅ COMPLETE** - See [FINAL-DECISION.md](./FINAL-DECISION.md)
- **Skill Folder Migration: ✅ COMPLETE** - See [SKILL-FOLDER-MIGRATION.md](./SKILL-FOLDER-MIGRATION.md)

**Key OSS Decisions (from FINAL-DECISION.md):**
- Community ready from day 1 (not phased)
- No tiers/badges - upvotes only (quality emerges from votes)
- Build everything in 1-2 days before launch
- CLI-first experience
- Stack Arena deferred to post-launch

## Issue Summary (49 Total)

### RESOLVED (2)

1. ~~**Agents consume 30-35% of context**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: 17% context usage in worst case is acceptable for short-lived subagents
4. ~~**Dynamic skill invocation is fake**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: All 36 skills now have proper YAML frontmatter

### NOT NEEDED (2)

10. ~~**No skill versioning**~~ → ❌ **NOT NEEDED**: Git history sufficient, no external consumers
11. ~~**No skill dependencies**~~ → ❌ **NOT NEEDED**: Skills are self-contained, bundles solve grouping

### CRITICAL (2) *(Updated 2026-01-08)*

2. **No test suite** - Zero test files exist
3. **No CI/CD** - No automated validation
5. **Schema/compiler mismatch** - Skill overrides silently ignored

### HIGH (12) *(#7, #8 re-investigated 2026-01-08)*

6. Schema validation IDE-only (no runtime)
7. Config redundancy (625+ lines) → **Solutions identified**: YAML anchors (40% reduction), profile defaults, skill bundles - see [ISSUE-7-8-PROPOSALS.md](./ISSUE-7-8-PROPOSALS.md)
8. Multi-file update workflow (5-7 files per agent) → 📋 **PLANNED**: Scaffolding CLI - see [ISSUE-7-8-PROPOSALS.md](./ISSUE-7-8-PROPOSALS.md)
9. Verification scripts doc-only
12. Redundant skill compilation
13. Workflow files ~80% duplicated
14. No config defaults mechanism
15. No file caching in compiler
16. Sequential compilation
17. Undocumented workflow tags (15+)
18. Excessive template whitespace
19. Missing MUST/SHOULD classification

### MEDIUM (18) & LOW (12)

See [ISSUES-INDEX.md](./ISSUES-INDEX.md) for complete list.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 3: Implementation (Priority Order)

**Foundation (Critical):**

1. Add test suite for compiler
2. Add CI/CD pipeline
3. Add Zod runtime validation

**Context Optimization (Critical):** 4. Reduce compiled agent sizes 5. Add file caching 6. Parallelize compilation

**DRY Refactoring (High):** 7. Extract common workflows 8. Implement config defaults 9. Create skill bundles

**Feature Completion (High):** 10. Fix or remove dynamic skill loading 11. Create scaffolding CLI 12. Save verification scripts

### Phase 4: Competitor Analysis

- `competitor-superclaude.md`
- `competitor-zebbern-claude-code-guide.md`
- `competitor-wshobson-agents.md`
- `competitor-claude-flow.md`

## Continuation Prompt

Use this to resume work in a new session:

```
Read .claude/research/findings/INDEX.md to get context on the architecture improvement project.

We completed Phase 1 (research with 12 agents) and Phase 2 (synthesis).
49 issues were identified across 12 areas.

I want to [CHOOSE ONE]:
- Proceed with Phase 3 implementation, starting with [critical/high/specific issue]
- Proceed with Phase 4 competitor analysis
- Deep dive into [specific area] findings
- Review the issues list and reprioritize
```
