@src/docs/SKILL-ATOMICITY-BIBLE.md
  @.claude/research/findings/FINAL-DECISION.md @src/docs/PROMPT_BIBLE.md
  @src/docs/CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md Go over these files and then I want for
  you to create a long list of new skills. You should use the researcher subagent
  to do comprehensive online research about valuable skills that are missing. You
  should then create a list of or a file that lists these new skills to be added
  and once the list hits 20 skills I want you to start creating these skills using
  the skill summoner agent and you should then also have the code reviewer agent
  review the code of these skills that were created and then use the skill
  summoner agent again to review the final skill and at each step making sure that
  it is 100% in compliance with our prompt bible and skill architecture
  documents. You should also make sure that these skills are atomic and that all
  of the major frameworks and stacks for frontend are covered, such as Next, which
  should cover things like SSR, Redux, more comprehensive unit testing and
  end-to-end testing, Vue and its libraries. The same with remix and solid and
  angular. Make sure that all sub-agents use Ultrathink and once you have created
  all of these skills and they've all been tested thoroughly, you are done.
