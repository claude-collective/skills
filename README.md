# Agents Inc Skills

The official skills marketplace for [Agents Inc](https://github.com/agents-inc/cli).

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)
[![Skills: 87+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Skills-87%2B-green.svg)](./src/skills)

Curated skills and pre-built stacks that you can install and customize via the [Agents Inc CLI](https://github.com/agents-inc/cli). This repo is structured content, not code: YAML + markdown files with metadata, used to give subagents domain-specific knowledge. All of the logic (installation, compilation, validation) lives in the [CLI](https://github.com/agents-inc/cli).

## Quick start

```bash
npx @agents-inc/cli init
```

The wizard walks you through selecting a stack or individual skills, then compiles subagents and generates a config file. See the [CLI repo](https://github.com/agents-inc/cli) for the full setup guide.

## How skills become subagents

Skills on their own are structured content, not code. The CLI compiles them into specialized subagents by combining skills with agent definitions and Liquid templates:

```
marketplace skills + agent definitions + Liquid templates
  → CLI compile
    → compiled subagents (.claude/agents/)
```

A `web-developer` subagent might get React, Tailwind, and Vitest skills. A `web-tester` gets Vitest, Playwright, and React Testing Library. Each subagent knows its domain deeply instead of knowing everything shallowly.

## Skill categories

Each skill covers patterns, conventions, anti-patterns, edge cases, and real code examples for a single technology. Not surface-level docs, but the kind of knowledge you'd normally have to explain to Claude repeatedly.

## Stacks

Stacks bundle related skills with pre-configured agents. Instead of picking skills individually, grab a stack that matches your setup:

- **nextjs-fullstack**: Next.js App Router + Hono + Drizzle + PostHog + Zustand + React Query
- **angular-stack**: Angular 19 + Signals + NgRx SignalStore + Hono + Drizzle
- **vue-stack**: Vue 3 Composition API + Pinia + Hono + Drizzle
- **nuxt-stack**: Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 full-stack + Pinia + Hono + Drizzle
- **remix-stack**: Remix + React + Hono + Drizzle
- **solidjs-stack**: SolidJS + Hono + Drizzle
- **react-native-stack**: React Native + Expo + Zustand + React Query
- **meta-stack**: Agents for creating agents, skills, docs, and extracting patterns

Each stack includes agents like `web-developer`, `api-developer`, `web-reviewer`, `web-tester`, `web-researcher`, `pattern-scout`, and `documentor`.

## Repository structure

```
src/
  skills/       # Source skills organized by category
  stacks/       # Stack configurations (skill bundles)
  agents/       # Agent definitions
  schemas/      # JSON schemas for validation
  docs/         # Documentation
```

## Contributing

### Adding a skill

1. Create a directory under `src/skills/<category>/<name>/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with the skill content
3. Add `reference.md` for API reference
4. Add an `examples/` directory with real code examples
5. Run the CLI to compile and verify

Each skill is a structured package. The naming convention is `<domain>/<subcategory>/<technology>` (e.g., `web/framework/react`). All YAML files are validated against public JSON schemas (in `src/schemas/`) generated from Zod types in the CLI, so malformed metadata or invalid references are caught immediately.

### Skill structure

```
src/skills/<category>/<name>/
├── SKILL.md           # Main skill content
├── metadata.yaml      # Version, compatibility, tags
├── reference.md       # API reference
└── examples/
    ├── core.md        # Core usage examples
    └── {topic}.md     # Topic-specific examples
```

### Stack config format

Stacks are defined in `src/stacks/<name>/config.yaml`:

```yaml
name: 'Stack Name'
description: 'What this stack covers'
author: '@handle'
version: '1.0.0'

skills:
  - id: web/framework/react
  - id: api/framework/hono
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies (for prettier hooks)
bun install

# Format files
bun run format
```
