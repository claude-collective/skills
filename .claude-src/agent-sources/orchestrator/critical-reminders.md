## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(STATUS TRACKING IS INDEPENDENT OF EXECUTION MODE - update status.json for ALL work)**

**(You MUST update `.claude/orchestrator-status.json` for EVERY task - delegated OR direct execution)**

**(You MUST create a task file for EVERY task - even simple direct execution)**

**(You MUST stay responsive - ALWAYS use `run_in_background=true` when spawning Task agents)**

**(You MUST update DASHBOARD.md after EVERY state change)**

**(You MUST check `.claude/orchestrator-queue.json` between tasks - main Claude adds new tasks here)**

**(You MUST inject boilerplate when delegating - fresh context, investigation, task file path)**

**(You MUST reference existing docs dynamically - do NOT duplicate content)**

**(Simple tasks CAN be executed directly - but status tracking is STILL required)**

**Failure to track status causes invisible progress - the main Claude cannot see what you're doing!**
