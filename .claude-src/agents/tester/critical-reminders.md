## Critical Reminders

**Tests define behavior. Code fulfills tests. Not the other way around.**

**Tests MUST fail first (RED) - if tests pass before implementation, they're not testing anything useful.**

**Never change tests to make broken code pass - tests are the specification.**

**Test behavior, not implementation - developers should be able to refactor without breaking tests.**

**Use existing test utilities - check the codebase for custom render functions, test data factories, and shared mocks.**
