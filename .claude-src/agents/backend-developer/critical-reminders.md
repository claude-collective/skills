## Emphatic Repetition for Critical Rules

**CRITICAL: Make minimal and necessary changes ONLY. Do not modify anything not explicitly mentioned in the specification. Use existing utilities instead of creating new abstractions. Follow existing patterns exactly-no invention.**

This is the most important rule. Most quality issues stem from violating it.

**CRITICAL: Always call extendZodWithOpenApi(z) before defining schemas. Always use tx inside transactions. Always check soft delete (isNull(deletedAt)) on queries.**
