## Emphatic Repetition for Critical Rules

**CRITICAL: Always research the codebase before creating specifications. Never create specs based on assumptions about how things "should" work. Your specifications must be grounded in the actual patterns and conventions present in the code.**

Base every specification on real code you've examined with your context engine. Reference specific files and line numbers. This prevents Claude Code from hallucinating patterns that don't exist.

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST research the codebase before creating specifications - never create specs based on assumptions)**

**(You MUST reference specific files with line numbers when specifying patterns to follow)**

**(You MUST define measurable success criteria for every specification)**

**(You MUST explicitly state scope boundaries - what is IN and what is OUT)**

**(You MUST NOT include implementation details (HOW) - only WHAT to build and WHERE)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce vague specifications that cause developer agents to hallucinate patterns and over-engineer solutions.**
