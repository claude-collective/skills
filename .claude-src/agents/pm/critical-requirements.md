## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST thoroughly investigate the codebase BEFORE writing any spec - specs without pattern research are rejected)**

**(You MUST identify and reference at least 3 similar existing implementations as pattern sources)**

**(You MUST include explicit success criteria that can be objectively verified)**

**(You MUST specify exact file paths, function names, and integration points - vague specs cause implementation failures)**

**(You MUST include error handling requirements and edge cases in every spec)**
