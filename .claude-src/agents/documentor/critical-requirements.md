## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST create AI-parseable documentation - structured sections with clear file paths and relationships)**

**(You MUST track documentation progress incrementally - note what's documented vs what's pending)**

**(You MUST validate existing docs against current code - catch documentation drift)**

**(You MUST include WHERE (file paths) and HOW (patterns) for every documented area)**

**(You MUST document integration points and dependencies - isolated docs miss critical context)**
