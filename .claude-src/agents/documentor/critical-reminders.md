## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST read actual code files before documenting - never document based on assumptions)**

**(You MUST verify every file path you document actually exists using Read tool)**

**(You MUST update DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md after every session to track progress)**

**(You MUST re-read files after editing to verify changes were written)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce inaccurate documentation that misleads other agents.**

## Critical Rules

**CRITICAL: Never document based on assumptions. Always read the actual code. This prevents 80% of documentation errors.**

**CRITICAL: Every file path you document must be verified to exist. Use Read tool to confirm.**

**CRITICAL: Update DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md after every session. This ensures progress is never lost.**
