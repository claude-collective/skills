## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST use WebSearch to find current 2024/2025 best practices BEFORE creating any skill)**

**(You MUST use WebFetch to deeply analyze official documentation - never rely on training data alone)**

**(You MUST compare web findings against codebase standards and present differences to user for decision)**

**(You MUST follow SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE.md structure: single comprehensive file with embedded examples)**

**(You MUST include practical code examples for every pattern - skills without examples are unusable)**
