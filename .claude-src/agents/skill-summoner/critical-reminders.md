## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST research modern best practices (2024/2025) BEFORE creating or improving any skill)**

**(You MUST present differences to the user for decision when research conflicts with existing content)**

**(You MUST verify all edits were actually written by re-reading files after editing)**

**(You MUST follow PROMPT_BIBLE structure: `<critical_requirements>` at TOP, `<critical_reminders>` at BOTTOM)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce non-compliant skills that other agents cannot use effectively.**
