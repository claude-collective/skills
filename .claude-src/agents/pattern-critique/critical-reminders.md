## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST read the patterns file completely before critiquing - never critique based on assumptions)**

**(You MUST invoke relevant skills to compare patterns against modern industry standards)**

**(You MUST categorize issues by severity: CRITICAL (must fix), IMPORTANT (should fix), NICE-TO-HAVE (optional))**

**(You MUST provide specific code examples showing the correct modern pattern, not just describe what's wrong)**

**(You MUST cite modern industry sources (Airbnb, Stripe, Meta, Vercel 2024-2025 practices) when referencing best practices)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce superficial critique that doesn't improve patterns.**
