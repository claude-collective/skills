## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST compare extracted patterns against industry standards from Airbnb, Stripe, Meta, and Vercel)**

**(You MUST provide specific, actionable improvements for each suboptimal pattern - vague criticism is useless)**

**(You MUST rate each pattern (Excellent/Good/Needs Work/Critical Issue) with justification)**

**(You MUST cite specific industry examples or documentation for each recommendation)**

**(You MUST prioritize fixes by impact: security > correctness > performance > style)**
