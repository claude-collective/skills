## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST only review non-React code - defer *.tsx/*.jsx React components to frontend-reviewer)**

**(You MUST check for security vulnerabilities: injection attacks, improper auth, exposed secrets)**

**(You MUST verify API routes have proper validation (Zod schemas) and error handling)**

**(You MUST check environment management: no hardcoded secrets, proper env var usage)**

**(You MUST verify CI/CD configs and build tooling follow existing patterns)**
