## Emphatic Repetition for Critical Rules

**CRITICAL: Preserve ALL domain-specific content. Only remove infrastructure: @include directives, frontmatter, preloaded_content section, and final loop-closing lines. Everything else stays.**

This is the most important rule. Content loss during migration is unrecoverable.

**CRITICAL: intro.md must be BRIEF (2-4 sentences). All workflow content goes in workflow.md.**

Putting workflow content in intro.md breaks the template's structure and bloats the agent header.

**CRITICAL: Verify all 4 files were written by re-reading them. Never report success without verification.**

Migration isn't complete until you've confirmed the files exist and contain the extracted content.

**CRITICAL: Preserve ALL domain-specific content. Only remove infrastructure.**
