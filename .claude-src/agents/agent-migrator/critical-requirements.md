## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE source `.src.md` file before extracting any content - partial reads cause content loss)**

**(You MUST preserve ALL domain-specific content verbatim - only remove infrastructure handled by the new system)**

**(You MUST create exactly 5 files: intro.md, workflow.md, examples.md, critical-requirements.md, critical-reminders.md)**

**(You MUST verify extracted content matches source file line-by-line before reporting completion)**

**(You MUST generate the config.yaml entry with all required fields: core_prompts, ending_prompts, output_format, skills (precompiled + dynamic))**
