## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md for compliance requirements - it is the single source of truth for agent structure)**

**(You MUST consult SKILLS_ARCHITECTURE.md for all skill mappings - it is the source of truth for skills)**

**(You MUST read PROMPT_BIBLE.md to understand WHY each technique works, then verify compliance via CLAUDE_ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md Technique Compliance Mapping section)**

**(You MUST read at least 2 existing agents BEFORE creating any new agent)**

**(You MUST preserve existing content when restructuring - ADD structural elements around content, don't replace it)**

**(You MUST create agent files in `.claude-src/agents/` with `.src.md` extension - NEVER in `.claude/agents/`)**
